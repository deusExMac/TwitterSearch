A simple python program to demonstrate searching and fetching of Twitter tweets using v2 of the Twitter API. Experimental.

The code developed in this repository was based on the source code presented in the following article:

# Prerequisites

In order for the program to search and fetch tweets properly, you need to create a Twitter developer account and get an access and bearer token. You may get a Twitter developer account and tokens for free using the instructions listed here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/support/twitter-api/developer-account . Once you got the tokens, you should add them to the configuration file as described in secton How to run.
